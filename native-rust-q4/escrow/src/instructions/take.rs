/// -- Data scheme --
/// > Bump [u8; 1]
///
/// -- Instruction Logic --
/// We introduce an authority account (that is the owner of the Vault), that has
/// defined Seeds derived from the Escrow PublicKey and this authority will be used
/// to sign the CPIs that are going to transfer the funds to the taker_ta_a and close
/// the vault Token Account.
///
/// Using the authority account permits to skip on a CPI for the creation of the TA
/// as owner of itself since it's a system account with deterministc seeds.
///
/// We then transfer the right amount of mint_b by getting it from the Escrow data to the
/// maker_ata_b that is ownerd by the maker.
///
/// We created a new macro to deserialize both the Token Account and the Escrow using pointers
/// and unsafe operation to optimize grabbing data from it. <T>::from_account_info(account)
///
/// Then we close the Escrow account by draining all the lamports and setting the data_len
/// to 0 (data_len starts 8 bytes before the actual data of the account) to prevent
/// reinitalization attack.
///
/// -- Client Side Logic --
/// - Derive the authority account from the Escrow PublicKey and pass in the bump.
/// - Create a Token Account owned by Maker and with mint_b as Mint
///
/// -- Account Optimization Logic --
/// - 4 accounts from the Anchor Escrow (maker, mint_a, mint_b, system_program)
/// + 1 account from the Anchor Escrow (authority)
///
/// -- Checks --
/// + Check that the maker_ata_b has maker as authority to enforce that the receiver of
///   the tokens is really the maker that created the escrow.
/// + Check that the vault has mint_a as the mint to enforce that we're transferring from
///   the right vault (we can't skip this since somebody could send the authority to a
///   worthless Token Account and the instruction will pass).
/// + Check that the maker_ta_b is the same as the one saved in the Escrow
